SimpleForum
===========

  Simple Forum enable you to create a very simple forum structure
  into any rails application.

Dependencies
============
 * will_paginate need to be installed
 * A User model with at least email and name attributes are required
 * A current_user method/helper should be provided (RESTful Authentication compatible)
 * RedCloth
 
Example
=======
  The first thing you have to do is install the plugin :
    # ./script/plugin install git://github.com/Gazer/simple-forum.git

  Next you have to do is create the migration file for your project and migrate your database :
    # ./script/generate simple_forum_migration [optinal name]
    # rake db:migrate

  And the last step is add routes to your routes.rb file:
    map.resources :forums do |forum|
      forum.resources :topics do |topic|
        topic.resources :posts
      end
    end

  Now you can go to your http://localhost:3000/forums URI and start using your new forum :)

Extending Controller
====================
 In case you want to set a custom layout, or add login validation to the forums
 you can add to the production.rb environment something like :

config.after_initialize do
  require 'application' unless Object.const_defined?(:ApplicationController)
  ForumsController.class_eval do
    include AuthenticatedSystem
    helper ApplicationHelper

    layout "application"

    before_filter :login_required
  end
  TopicsController.class_eval do
    include AuthenticatedSystem
    helper ApplicationHelper

    layout "application"

    before_filter :login_required
  end
  PostsController.class_eval do
    include AuthenticatedSystem
    helper ApplicationHelper

    layout "application"

    before_filter :login_required
  end
end

 Note : Using this in development environment will not work because Rails does not reload the plugins
 on each request

TODO
====
 * Subforums support
 * Admin panel (maybe :)
 * User/Post moderation
