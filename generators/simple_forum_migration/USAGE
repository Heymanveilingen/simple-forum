Description:
    The simple forum migration generator creates a migration for the forums model.

    The generator takes a migration name as its argument.  The migration name may be
    given in CamelCase or under_score.  'add_simple_forum_tables' is the default.

    The generator creates a migration class in db/migrate prefixed by its number
    in the queue.

Example:
    ./script/generate simple_forum_migration add_simple_forum_tables
